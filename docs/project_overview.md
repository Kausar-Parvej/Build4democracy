# Project Overview  
FactCheck BD

## Introduction  
FactCheck BD is a concept-stage civic-tech project designed to address the rising challenges of misinformation within Bangladesh’s digital space. The project aims to create an accessible, AI-assisted fact-checking tool that helps everyday users, journalists, and civic groups verify claims, images, and social media content quickly and reliably.

## Background  
Bangladesh’s online ecosystem experiences frequent waves of unverified claims, manipulated images, and misleading narratives. Traditional fact-checkers often cannot keep up with the volume and speed of misinformation. Many users, especially those in rural or underserved communities, do not have the digital skills or resources to verify online content independently.

This project was initiated as part of the Build4Democracy Hackathon to explore practical, inclusive, and safe approaches to improving information integrity.

## Core Goals  
- Provide a simple way for users to check the credibility of claims or images  
- Reduce the spread of misleading content by offering fast, clear verification  
- Support journalists and civic organizations in their workflows  
- Make verification tools accessible to low-bandwidth and low-literacy users  
- Ensure privacy, safety, and ethical constraints are respected throughout

## Key Features (Planned)  
- Submission of text claims, image uploads, or social media snippets  
- AI-assisted cross-checking with reliable sources  
- Basic media forensics for detecting manipulated images  
- Contextual explanations rather than binary “true/false” results  
- Bangla-friendly, mobile-first interface  
- Built-in misuse prevention (e.g., no verification of private individuals)

## Project Status  
The project is currently in the **idea/concept stage**.  
Problem analysis, user needs, safety guidelines, and initial design directions have been outlined. Prototype development will begin during the hackathon.

## Future Directions  
- Develop a working verification prototype  
- Iterate through user testing sessions (women, rural youth, NGOs)  
- Integrate structured fact-checking datasets  
- Expand the tool to support more media formats  
- Form partnerships with local digital literacy initiatives
