# Contributing to FactCheck Assist

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project is still in an early-stage “Idea” phase, so contributions that help shape direction, research, or basic scaffolding are welcome.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
If you find a bug, an unclear explanation, or an improvement opportunity:
- Open an issue with a clear title.
- Provide context, expected behaviour, and steps to reproduce if applicable.

### 2. Suggesting Features
Feature suggestions should include:
- A problem statement  
- Why the feature helps users  
- A simple outline of how it might work  

### 3. Code Contributions
The project structure is minimal at this stage. If submitting code:
- Use clear, modular Python.
- Follow PEP8 formatting.
- Provide comments where logic may be ambiguous.

### 4. Documentation Improvements
Even small improvements (clarity, grammar, examples) are appreciated.
