# FactCheck BD  
AI-assisted fact-checking and verification tool  
(Build4Democracy Hackathon – Bangladesh)

## Overview  
FactCheck BD is a lightweight, accessible fact-checking and verification tool designed to help citizens, journalists, and civic actors verify claims, images, and social media content. The goal is to make reliable verification fast, transparent, and usable for a wide range of communities in Bangladesh, including those with limited digital resources.

## Problem  
Misinformation spreads quickly across Bangladesh’s online platforms, often outpacing traditional fact-checking efforts. Users struggle to evaluate the credibility of viral posts, edited images, and sensational claims. Existing verification processes are slow, centralized, and not easily accessible to the general public, especially users in rural areas or those with lower digital literacy.

## Proposed Solution  
FactCheck BD provides a simple workflow where users can submit posts, images, or claims and receive AI-assisted verification based on credible sources, contextual explanations, and basic media forensics. The tool emphasizes clarity, transparency, and safe usage. The interface is Bangla-friendly, mobile-first, and designed to work on low bandwidth.

## Primary Users  
- General social media users  
- Journalists and newsroom fact-checkers  
- Civic actors, NGOs, and digital literacy groups  
- Students and youth communities

## Privacy and Safety  
The tool follows a minimal data collection approach, processes submissions securely, and automatically deletes temporary content. No identifiable or political profiles are stored. Safeguards are in place to prevent misuse such as doxxing, targeted harassment, or attempts to verify private individuals.

## Inclusion  
The platform is designed to be accessible on low-end devices, supports Bangla by default, and avoids complex or text-heavy workflows. We aim to involve women, rural users, and marginalized communities in early testing and outreach to ensure the tool reflects their needs and risks.

## Expected Outcomes  
In early stages, we aim to reach a few thousand users, verify a meaningful volume of claims and images, and demonstrate clear improvements in clarity, speed, and accessibility of fact-checking. Another priority is to establish partnerships with local media, youth groups, and literacy initiatives.

## Project Status  
Idea / Concept Stage  
The problem, user groups, safety considerations, and solution direction are defined. The first working prototype will be developed during the hackathon.
